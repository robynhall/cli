"""
Runs a pathogen build in an ephemeral container.

The build directory should contain a Snakefile, which will be run with
snakemake inside the container.

Docker is the currently the only supported container system.  It must be
installed and configured, which you can test by running:

    nextstrain check-setup

The `nextstrain build` command is designed to cleanly separate the Nextstrain
build interface from Docker itself so that we can more seamlessly use other
container systems in the future as desired or necessary.
